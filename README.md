<!-- Projects -->
## Projects
- üöÄ [Ethical Decision Making and Leadership Development Chatbot](https://github.com/seetharamarao817/Chatbot-using-Bhagavad-Gita-Teachings-): This project aims to create an intelligent chatbot that provides ethical guidance and leadership development insights based on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand user queries and generate meaningful responses rooted in the Bhagavad Gita's wisdom.
- üåê [Image Classification with ResNets](https://github.com/seetharamarao817/Image_classification-with-ResNets-): This project demonstrates image classification using ResNet neural networks. We train a ResNet model on the CIFAR10 dataset and evaluate its performance on unseen data. We provide clear instructions on how to train, evaluate, and use the model.
